# SequenceAlignment
Performs the DNA sequence alignment. Provides two classes, one for the basic sequence alignment with a O(mn) space complexity and O(mn) time complexity. Second is the Space Efficient sequence alignment with a O(m+n) space and O(mn) time complexity. Space efficient sequence alignment is constant(2) time slower than basic sequence alignment
